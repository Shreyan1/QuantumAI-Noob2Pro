# QuantumAI-Noob2Pro
Building the first OpenSource QuantumAI repo for guiding noobs to pro

- Read the `0-ReadFIRST.ipynb` to understand the required concepts before diving into the problems.

- **Problem 1 :** Flip a single bit (0 to 1 or 1 to 0) using a quantum gate

- **Problem 2 :** Creating superposition using the Hadamard (H) Gate

- **Problem 3 :** Create an entangled Bell State using CNOT Gate

- **Problem 4 :** Quantum Teleportation - Transfer the state of one qubit to another, using entanglement and classical communication.

- **Problem 5 :**
