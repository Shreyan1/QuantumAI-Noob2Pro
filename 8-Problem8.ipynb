    "**What is QPCA?**\n",
    "\n",
    "QPCA is the quantum counterpart of classical PCA. It is used to:\n",
    "- Extract the most significant components (principal components) of a dataset.\n",
    "- Reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In QPCA:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset is encoded as a quantum density matrix.\n",
    "- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the density matrix represent the principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it Useful?**\n",
    "- QPCA can efficiently analyze large datasets encoded in quantum states.\n",
    "- It serves as a preprocessing step for quantum machine learning algorithms.\n",
